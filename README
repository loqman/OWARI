OWARI is played on a board with 14 holes arranged as two rows of 6
with two holes in the middle on the ends of the rows.  Complete rules
of the game are int Owari: the rules of the game.

The STATE of the game is very simple to describe.  All you need
to keep track of are the number of stones in each of the fourteen
holes (and whose turn it is, but that can be done automatically).
Let's represent the board as a list of 14 numbers.  The first
six will be the player's holes, the seventh will be the
player's goal hole, the next six will be the computer's holes
(counting counter-clockwise around the board) and the 14th will
be the computer's goal hole.  So the list 
(1 3 0 2 2 2 6 4 2 1 0 8 1 11)
would represent the board position:

     1  8  0  1  2  4
 11                    6
     1  3  0  2  2  2

For the purposes of this program, holes are numbered from 0 to 13,
beginning with the player's first hole and going counterclockwise.
So above, there is 1 stone in hole number 0, 3 in hole number 1,
4 in number 7, 11 in number 13, etc.

1. Owari: the rules of the game
Each player has six pits lined up horizontally in front of him or her, and a "goal" pit on the side
to the right. When you play against the computer, the board will be represented as a picture:
     3 3 3 3 3 3
0                    0
     3 3 3 3 3 3
with your pits at the bottom, your goal pit at the right, and the computer's pits at the top and goal
pit at the left. The picture above shows the start position: each pit has 3 stones in it, except for
the goal pits which are empty.
To make a move, a player chooses one of the six pits on his or her side of the board (the chosen
pit must have stones in it) and redistributes (or "sows") the stones one-by-one going counterclockwise
around the board, starting with the pit following the one picked. The opponent's goal
pit, if reached, is skipped. For the purposes of this implementation, the pits on the player's side
are numbered 0 to 5, with 6 being the player's goal pit, and the computer's pits are numbered 7 to
12 from right to left (i.e. continuing counter-clockwise) with the computer's goal pit number 13.
If on your first turn you choose to move from pit number 4, the resulting position would be:
     3 3 3 3 3 4
0                    1
     3 3 3 3 0 4

Capturing: If the last stone of a player's move falls into an empty pit on the moving player's side
of the board, then any stones in the pit opposite to it are captured and placed in the moving
player's goal pit. For instance, if it were your turn in the position shown above, you could
choose to move from pit number 1 (remember that the leftmost pit on your side is number 0) and
the resulting position would be:
     3 3 3 3 0 4
0                    4
     3 0 4 4 1 4
in which the stones from pit number 8 have been captured and placed in your goal pit.

Ending the game: When either player empties all six pits on his or her side of the board, the
game is over. The other player takes all the remaining stones from his or her own side, and
places them in his or her goal pit. Players count the stones in their goal pits. The player with the
most stones is the winner.

NOTE: Implimentation of the minimax with alpha beta pruning is completed.
	But still there is some stuff that I must work on them.
	The Computer class works only if you pass the computer player as the 
	second player to the OWARI, and you can only use one computer bot in the
	game.
